            - **Dashboard:** It contains visualizations of the dataset used to train the models. 
            You can select between the 3 different types using a drop down menu. An **EDA** dashboard, an analytics **KPIs** dashboard with filtering capabilities and 
            a **model explainer** dashboard with Confusion matrix, AUC ROC Curves and a feature importances visualization to understand the drivers of customer churn for the leading model.        
            - **Predict:** Contains a list of models in a drop down with corresponding pipelines used to predict customer churn. There are two tabs namely predict and bulk predict for single and bulk prediction(s) respectively. 
            The bulk predict allow users to upload of csv or excel files with same schema as the data used for training and testing. 
            A toggle button allow users to make predictions by way of searching a particular customer or several customers in the predict and bulk predict tabs respectively.  
            - **History:** This page contains table view of the past predictions made including their churn, probability, model used and time stamp.
